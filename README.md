## Description

This is a simple html page with a timer.

It allows to set how long a timer lapse lasts for and how many times it should be repeated.

The app emits a specific sound for the beginning of a lapse, its end and the end of all the<br/>
lapses. So doing, the app can be run in the background or simply without looking at it.
